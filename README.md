ElasticUI
=========

ElasticUI is a set of AngularJS directives enabling developers to rapidly build a frontend on top of Elasticsearch. It builds upon the elastic.js implementation of the Elasticsearch DSL.

**The concept of ElasticUI is to have one "view" of your index to which you can add aggregations, sorting, paging, filters by adding directives in your html.**

Getting started
---
The easiest way to get started is to checkout the [demo file][3] (or [jsfiddle][6]). 
This file demonstrates a simple use of facets, search and pagination. 
Just change 4 fields in the source to match your Elasticsearch setup and mapping.

_If you are not serving the demo page from Elasticsearch you might have to enable [CORS](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html) and allow requests to Elasticsearch from your host._

**Changing the UI of the widgets in the Demo**

The widgets in the demo file are simple templates built upon the ElasticUI components (see below).
[Learn how they work and how to modify them][4].

Creating a project from scratch
---
Add the following files to your Angular project:

 - elasticui.js from dist/
 - elastic.js from [fullscale/elastic.js][1]
 - elasticsearch.angular.js from [elasticsearch.org][2] or alternatively [elasticsearch.angular.simple.js][7]

Set up ElasticUI in your project by defining your ElasticSearch host as *euiHost*:

    angular.module('yourApp', ['elasticui']).constant('euiHost', 'http://localhost:9200');

Set the `eui-index="'INDEX_NAME'"` on the `<body>` tag, now you can get started adding ElasticUI components to your view (see below).

Components
===
The directives you can use for aggregations (facets), sorting, paging and filtering your view are documented in [docs/components.md][5].
These components are the core of ElasticUI and is what you'd want to build your own front-end on.

For example, creating an aggregation and listing the buckets it returns is as simple as:

    <ul eui-aggregation="ejs.TermsAggregation('agg_name').field('AGG_FIELD').size(10)">
        <li ng-repeat="bucket in aggResult.buckets">{{bucket}}</li>
    </ul>
